## 10 定时图

这只是个提案，主题和内容可能改变.

非常欢迎您参与这个新特性的讨论。您的反馈、创意和建议可以帮助我们找寻适合的解决方案。

### 10.1 声明参与者

使用 concise or robust 关键字声明参与者, 选择哪个取决于所需的显示样式。

通过 @ 标注, 和 is 动词定义状态.

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
robust "Web 浏览器" as WB
concise "Web 用户" as WU
@0
WU is 空闲
WB is 空闲
@100
WU is 等待中
WB is 处理中
@300
WB is 等待中
@enduml
```

### 10.2 Binary and Clock

It's also possible to have binary and clock signal, using the following keywords:
* binary
* clock

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
clock clk with period 1
binary "Enable" as EN
@0
EN is low
@5
EN is high
@10
EN is low
@enduml
```

### 10.3 增加消息

使用下述的语法增加对消息的描述。

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
robust "Web 浏览器" as WB
concise "Web 用户" as WU
@0
WU is 空闲
WB is 空闲
@100
WU -> WB : URL
WU is 等待中
WB is 处理中
@300
WB is 等待中
@enduml
```

### 10.4 相对时间

It is possible to use relative time with @.

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
robust "DNS Resolver" as DNS
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU
@0
WU is Idle
WB is Idle
DNS is Idle
@+100
WU -> WB : URL
WU is Waiting
WB is Processing
@+200
WB is Waiting
WB -> DNS@+50 : Resolve URL
@+100
DNS is Processing
@+300
DNS is Idle
@enduml
```

### 10.5 Anchor Points

Instead of using absolute or relative time on an absolute time you can define a time as an anchor point by using the as keyword and starting the name with a :.

@XX as :<anchor point name>

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
clock clk with period 1
binary "enable" as EN
concise "dataBus" as db
@0 as :start
@5 as :en_high
@10 as :en_low
@:start
EN is low
db is "0x0000"
@:en_high
EN is high
@:en_low
EN is low
@:en_high-2
db is "0xf23a"
@:en_high+6
db is "0x0000"
@enduml
```

### 10.6 Participant oriented

Rather than declare the diagram in chronological order, you can define it by participant.

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU
@WB
0 is idle
+200 is Proc.
+100 is Waiting
@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@enduml
```

### 10.7 Setting scale

You can also set a specific scale.

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
concise "Web User" as WU
scale 100 as 50 pixels
@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@enduml
```

### 10.8 Initial state

You can also define an inital state.

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU
WB is Initializing
WU is Absent
@WB
0 is idle
+200 is Processing
+100 is Waiting
@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@enduml
```

### 10.9 Intricated state

A signal could be in some undefined state.

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
robust "Signal1" as S1
robust "Signal2" as S2
S1 has 0,1,2,hello
S2 has 0,1,2
@0
S1 is 0
S2 is 0
@100
S1 is {0,1} #SlateGrey
S2 is {0,1}
@200
S1 is 1
S2 is 0
@300
S1 is hello
S2 is {0,2}
@enduml
```

### 10.10 Hidden state

It is also possible to hide some state.

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
concise "Web User" as WU
@0
WU is {-}
@100
WU is A1
@200
WU is {-}
@300
WU is {hidden}
@400
WU is A3
@500
WU is {-}
@enduml
```

### 10.11 Hide time axis

It is possible to hide time axis.

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
hide time-axis
concise "Web User" as WU
WU is Absent
@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@enduml
```

### 10.12 Using Time and Date

It is possible to use time or date.

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU
@2019/07/02
WU is Idle
WB is Idle
@2019/07/04
WU is Waiting : some note
WB is Processing : some other note
@2019/07/05
WB is Waiting
@enduml
```

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU
@1:15:00
WU is Idle
WB is Idle
@1:16:30
WU is Waiting : some note
WB is Processing : some other note
@1:17:30
WB is Waiting
@enduml
```

### 10.13 Adding constraint


It is possible to display time constraints on the diagrams.

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU
WB is Initializing
WU is Absent
@WB
0 is idle
+200 is Processing
+100 is Waiting
WB@0 <-> @50 : {50 ms lag}
@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@200 <-> @+150 : {150 ms}
@enduml
```

### 10.14 Highlighted period

You can higlight a part of diagram.

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU
@0
WU is Idle
WB is Idle
@100
WU -> WB : URL
WU is Waiting #LightCyan;line:Aqua
@200
WB is Proc.
@300
WU -> WB@350 : URL2
WB is Waiting
@+200
WU is ok
@+200
WB is Idle
highlight 200 to 450 #Gold;line:DimGrey : This is my caption
@enduml
```

### 10.15 Adding texts

You can optionally add a title, a header, a footer, a legend and a caption:

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
Title Some title
header: Some header
footer: Some footer
legend
Some legend
end legend
caption Some caption
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU
@0
WU is Idle
WB is Idle
@100
WU is Waiting
WB is Processing
@300
WB is Waiting
@enduml
```

### 10.16 Complete example

Thanks to Adam Rosien for this example.

```plantuml {hide=false}
@startuml
concise "Client" as Client
concise "Server" as Server
concise "Response freshness" as Cache
Server is idle
Client is idle
@Client
0 is send
Client -> Server@+25 : GET
+25 is await
+75 is recv
+25 is idle
+25 is send
Client -> Server@+25 : GET\nIf-Modified-Since: 150
+25 is await
+50 is recv
+25 is idle
@100 <-> @275 : no need to re-request from server
@Server
25 is recv
+25 is work
+25 is send
Server -> Client@+25 : 200 OK\nExpires: 275
+25 is idle
+75 is recv
+25 is send
Server -> Client@+25 : 304 Not Modified
+25 is idle
@Cache
75 is fresh
+200 is stale
@enduml
```
