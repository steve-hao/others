However, Unicode strings and 8-bit strings cannot be mixed: that is, you cannot match a Unicode string with a byte pattern or vice-versa; similarly, when asking for a substitution, the replacement string must be of the same type as both the pattern and the search string.\n","\n","Regular expressions use the backslash character (`'\\'`) to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write&nbsp;`'\\\\\\\\'`&nbsp;as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be&nbsp;`\\\\`, and each backslash must be expressed as&nbsp;`\\\\`&nbsp;inside a regular Python string literal. Also, please note that any invalid escape sequences in Python’s usage of the backslash in string literals now generate a&nbsp;[`DeprecationWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning \"DeprecationWarning\")&nbsp;and in the future this will become a&nbsp;[`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError \"SyntaxError\"). This behaviour will happen even if it is a valid escape sequence for a regular expression.\n","\n","The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with&nbsp;`'r'`. So&nbsp;`r\"\\n\"`&nbsp;is a two-character string containing&nbsp;`'\\'`&nbsp;and&nbsp;`'n'`, while&nbsp;`\"\\n\"`&nbsp;is a one-character string containing a newline. Usually patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw string notation.\n","\n","It is important to note that most regular expression operations are available as module-level functions and methods on&nbsp;[compiled regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re-objects). The functions are shortcuts that don’t require you to compile a regex object first, but miss some fine-tuning parameters.\n","\n","See also\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","\n","The third-party&nbsp;[regex](https://pypi.org/project/regex/)&nbsp;module, which has an API compatible with the standard library&nbsp;[`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re \"re: Regular expression operations.\")&nbsp;module, but offers additional functionality and a more thorough Unicode support.\n","\n","## Regular Expression Syntax[](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax \"Permalink to this headline\")\n","\n","A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular string, which comes down to the same thing).\n","\n","Regular expressions can be concatenated to form new regular expressions; if&nbsp;_A_&nbsp;and&nbsp;_B_&nbsp;are both regular expressions, then&nbsp;_AB_&nbsp;is also a regular expression. In general, if a string&nbsp;_p_&nbsp;matches&nbsp;_A_&nbsp;and another string&nbsp;_q_matches&nbsp;_B_, the string&nbsp;_pq_&nbsp;will match AB. This holds unless&nbsp;_A_&nbsp;or&nbsp;_B_&nbsp;contain low precedence operations; boundary conditions between&nbsp;_A_&nbsp;and&nbsp;_B_; or have numbered group references. Thus, complex expressions can easily be constructed from simpler primitive expressions like the ones described here. For details of the theory and implementation of regular expressions, consult the Friedl book&nbsp;[[Frie09]](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#frie09), or almost any textbook about compiler construction.\n","\n","A brief explanation of the format of regular expressions follows. For further information and a gentler presentation, consult the&nbsp;[Regular Expression HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#regex-howto).\n","\n","Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters. Most ordinary characters, like&nbsp;`'A'`,&nbsp;`'a'`, or&nbsp;`'0'`, are the simplest regular expressions; they simply match themselves. You can concatenate ordinary characters, so&nbsp;`last`&nbsp;matches the string&nbsp;`'last'`. (In the rest of this section, we’ll write RE’s in&nbsp;`this special style`, usually without quotes, and strings to be matched&nbsp;`'in single quotes'`.)\n","\n","Some characters, like&nbsp;`'|'`&nbsp;or&nbsp;`'('`, are special. Special characters either stand for classes of ordinary characters, or affect how the regular expressions around them are interpreted.\n","\n","Repetition qualifiers (`*`,&nbsp;`+`,&nbsp;`?`,&nbsp;`{m,n}`, etc) cannot be directly nested. This avoids ambiguity with the non-greedy modifier suffix&nbsp;`?`, and with other modifiers in other implementations. To apply a second repetition to an inner repetition, parentheses may be used. For example, the expression&nbsp;`(?:a{6})*`&nbsp;matches any multiple of six&nbsp;`'a'`characters.\n","\n","The special characters are:\n","\n","`.`\n",":    (Dot.) In the default mode, this matches any character except a newline.

More interestingly, searching for&nbsp;`foo.$`&nbsp;in&nbsp;`'foo1\\nfoo2\\n'`&nbsp;matches ‘foo2’ normally, but ‘foo1’ in&nbsp;[`MULTILINE`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.MULTILINE \"re.MULTILINE\")&nbsp;mode; searching for a single&nbsp;`$`&nbsp;in&nbsp;`'foo\\n'`&nbsp;will find two (empty) matches: one just before the newline, and one at the end of the string.\n","\n","`*`\n",":    Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or more repetitions of the preceding RE, as many repetitions as are possible.&nbsp;`ab*`&nbsp;will match ‘a’, ‘ab’, or ‘a’ followed by any number of ‘b’s.\n","\n","`+`\n",":    Causes the resulting RE to match 1 or more repetitions of the preceding RE.&nbsp;`ab+`&nbsp;will match ‘a’ followed by any non-zero number of ‘b’s; it will not match just ‘a’.\n","\n","`?`\n",":    Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding RE.&nbsp;`ab?`&nbsp;will match either ‘a’ or ‘ab’.\n","\n","`*?`,&nbsp;`+?`,&nbsp;`??`\n",":    The&nbsp;`'*'`,&nbsp;`'+'`, and&nbsp;`'?'`&nbsp;qualifiers are all&nbsp;_greedy_; they match as much text as possible. Sometimes this behaviour isn’t desired; if the RE&nbsp;`<.*>`&nbsp;is matched against&nbsp;`'<a> b <c>'`, it will match the entire string, and not just&nbsp;`'<a>'`. Adding&nbsp;`?`&nbsp;after the qualifier makes it perform the match in&nbsp;_non-greedy_&nbsp;or&nbsp;_minimal_&nbsp;fashion; as&nbsp;_few_characters as possible will be matched. Using the RE&nbsp;`<.*?>`&nbsp;will match only&nbsp;`'<a>'`.\n","\n","`{m}`\n",":    Specifies that exactly&nbsp;_m_&nbsp;copies of the previous RE should be matched; fewer matches cause the entire RE not to match. For example,&nbsp;`a{6}`&nbsp;will match exactly six&nbsp;`'a'`&nbsp;characters, but not five.\n","\n","`{m,n}`\n",":    Causes the resulting RE to match from&nbsp;_m_&nbsp;to&nbsp;_n_&nbsp;repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to match as many repetitions as possible. For example,&nbsp;`a{3,5}`&nbsp;will match from 3 to 5&nbsp;`'a'`&nbsp;characters. Omitting&nbsp;_m_&nbsp;specifies a lower bound of zero, and omitting&nbsp;_n_&nbsp;specifies an infinite upper bound. As an example,&nbsp;`a{4,}b`&nbsp;will match&nbsp;`'aaaab'`&nbsp;or a thousand&nbsp;`'a'`&nbsp;characters followed by a&nbsp;`'b'`, but not&nbsp;`'aaab'`. The comma may not be omitted or the modifier would be confused with the previously described form.\n","\n","`{m,n}?`\n",":    Causes the resulting RE to match from&nbsp;_m_&nbsp;to&nbsp;_n_&nbsp;repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to match as&nbsp;_few_repetitions as possible. This is the non-greedy version of the previous qualifier. For example, on the 6-character string&nbsp;`'aaaaaa'`,&nbsp;`a{3,5}`&nbsp;will match 5&nbsp;`'a'`&nbsp;characters, while&nbsp;`a{3,5}?`&nbsp;will only match 3 characters.\n","\n","`\\`\n",":    Either escapes special characters (permitting you to match characters like&nbsp;`'*'`,&nbsp;`'?'`, and so forth), or signals a special sequence; special sequences are discussed below.\n","    \n","If you’re not using a raw string to express the pattern, remember that Python also uses the backslash as an escape sequence in string literals; if the escape sequence isn’t recognized by Python’s parser, the backslash and subsequent character are included in the resulting string. However, if Python would recognize the resulting sequence, the backslash should be repeated twice. This is complicated and hard to understand, so it’s highly recommended that you use raw strings for all but the simplest expressions.\n","\n","`[]`\n",":Used to indicate a set of characters.

If&nbsp;`-`&nbsp;is escaped (e.g.&nbsp;`[a\\-z]`) or if it’s placed as the first or last character (e.g.&nbsp;`[-a]`&nbsp;or&nbsp;`[a-]`), it will match a literal&nbsp;`'-'`.\n","*  Special characters lose their special meaning inside sets.
