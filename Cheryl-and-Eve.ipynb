[Gabe Gaster](http://www.gabegaster.com/) proved me right when he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/gabegaster/status/593976413314777089/photo/1)  that he had extended my code to generate a new list of dates that satisfies the constraints of the puzzle:\n",

    "This is a slight modification of my [previous code](Cheryl.ipynb), and I'll give a slight modification of the explanation. The puzzle concerns these concepts:\n",

    "- **Hearing** the statements about knowledge.\n",

    "- `DATES` is a set of all possible dates (each date is a string); we also consider subsets of `DATES`.\n",
    "- `know(possible_dates)` is a function that returns `True` when there is only one possible date.\n",
    "- `tell(part)` is a function that returns the set of possible dates after Cheryl tells a part (month or day).\n",
    "- *`statement`*`(date)` returns true for dates that satisfy the statement.\n",
    "- `hear(possible_dates, statement,...)` returns a subset of possible_dates that are still possible after hearing the statements.\n",

    "For example, `albert1` is Albert's first statement, which says in part that he knows that Bernard\n",
    "does not yet know Cheryl's birthday. So `albert1('May 19')` should be `False`, because if May 19 were Cheryl's birthday, then she would have told Bernard `'19'`, he would know that `'May 19'` is the only possibility.\n",
